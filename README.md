üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a Software Developer and all round tech enthusiast based in Christchurch, NZ and love learning!

I am a curious george and love exploring new ways of getting things done. This has led me to switch from 20 years in Hospitality to re-training, completing first a Diploma in Software Development and now a Bachelors in IT: Software Development.

Outside of computing (including gaming) I like to make the most of life and my keen passions are travel, creating new experiences and meeting new people.
